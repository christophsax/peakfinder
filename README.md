# peakfinder

Contains a single function, to interactively determine the peak of a densitiy estimation. 

**Not too useful at this point!**

```r
remotes::install_github("christophsax/peakfinder")
library(peakfinder)
peakfinder(AirPassengers)
```

A data frame with peak coordinates is shown in the second tab. Press 'Done'
to return the data frame to the R console.
